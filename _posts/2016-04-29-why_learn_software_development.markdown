Software Development means lots of things in the computer science world. But to bring it down to its most basic facet, software development is basically bringing your imagination to life before your very eyes.

Coding in and of itself is a very rewarding field, but to be able to think of a great app, game, website, whatever, and then to transcribe it and create many building blocks to arrive at that very thought that has been brewing inside your head, is a feeling like no other.

There are few things greater than the joy one gets when he / she builds something completely from scratch, and have other people that love to use it. Whether it's the next best website, a cool app, an addictive little game, if you have the knowledge, you can build anything you want via coding, and to describe the broadness of something like that in words would do it injustice.

To answer the title's question - I started learning software development because when it comes to developing and code, the sky is the limit. There are so many different paths and solutions to arrive at the end of the road, it makes the learning and absorption to get there as fun and rewarding as waking up on Christmas morning...
