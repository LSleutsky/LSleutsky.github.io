title:  Why Learn Software Development?

Software Development means lots of things in the computer science world. But to bring it down to its most basic facet, software development is basically bringing your imagination to life before your very eyes. Athletes play sports; artists paint; kids play; coders, well, code.

In my opinion, being a software developer is tantamount to playing with **_Legos_**.

With a nice set of **_Legos_**, kids can basically build that awesome fortress, or super fast spaceship, or whatever their whacky kid minds come up with (bless their hearts!). Coding is no different, really, if you think about it. Whether you make yourself a simple little task manager, a cool game to share amongst your friends, or the next great app, you and you alone buil it (well if you worked on it alone, obviously), and no one can take that away from you!

There's just something about having a small idea, then planning and noting an outline of what you want to build, then having that snowball into an elegant and powerful codebase. With the vast array of different programming languages, libraries, tools & extensions out there, one can easily get lost within the plethora of information; but that's what makes it so great! With the right fortitude and honing your skillset, I believe that if you dedicate yourself to it, and learn off the uncountable amount of mistakes which will surely be made, the pot at the end of the rainbow, so to speak, is a treat like no other!

It's rather hard to transcribe in words *why* someone should learn sofware development, because reasons change from person to person. A big reason, however, is how rewarding of a field it is. Not only do you have a higher sense of worth when you build something yourself from scratch (that works), but the market is on a pretty steady uprise, and the compensation ain't to shabby either. On top of all that, collaborating with intelligent cohorts, and being able to work efffectively as a team member to arrive at a solution, is just like the icing on top of the cake. Really fun and challenging field? Check! Meet lots of cool and smart people? Check! Feel great and accomplished when you build something worthwhile via coding it? Check, and double check!

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I must reiterate - there are few things greater than the joy one gets when they build something completely from scratch, and have other people that love to use it, and want to assist in adding to it (if you the author allows) to make it even better. Whether it's the next best website, a cool app, an addictive little game, if you have the knowledge, you can build **anything** you want to by coding and programming it, and to describe the vastness of something like that in words would do it injustice.

To wrap this tirade up, and answer the title's question - I personally started learning software development because when it comes to developing and computer programming, the sky is the limit. There are so many different paths and solutions to arrive at the end of the road, it makes the learning and absorption to get there as fun and rewarding as waking up on Christmas morning. Oh, and the fact that jobs pay damn well doesn't hurt either. I want to be able to enjoy knowing that I am waking up the next day and going to a job I enjoy, with a career path that keeps on evolving, and the only obstacles in my way are the ones I make...
