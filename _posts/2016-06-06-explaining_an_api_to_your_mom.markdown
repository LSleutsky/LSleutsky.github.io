So what exactly is an API? Well, in layman's terms - it is a an Application Programming Interface. A whaaaaat?! Yea, exactly...

Forunately or unfortunately, it's getting damn hard these days to discuss tech without running into referencing an API, in one way or another. The most bare bones explanation of what an API is, is essentially APIs are a set of requirements and / or rules that dictate how one application can communicate with another. APIs make it possible to move information from one program to another, by providing shortcuts and various goodies to make your life easier, and to provide a more elegant solution.

On the internet, big companies like Facebook, Google, etc. use APIs to piggyback off each other's respective features and apps, in a sense. An example being that if you do a Yelp search for the best Italian food around, you are more than likely to see a map pop up showing the location of said restaurant. Well that map with that location marker is more than likely a Google Maps API. What's awesome about APIs is that they make it possible for all sorts of different applications to share data across various platforms, and make the end user's life a whoooole lot easier!

In a nutshell, APIs are great time savers - a great example being allowing Facebook or Google the option to sign you in to certain games or apps, so that you don't have to keep creating multiple accounts and going through the entire registration process ("*that's APIs at work, ma!*").

On the development side of things, APIs make it for developers to have a large mish-mosh of various platforms sets of features, and create entirely new services with the best combinations that each company may have to offer. The availabality of APIs these days is one of the main reasons for such a seamless and modern web experience.

Without confusing mom too much, this is the best way to explain what APIs do, as far as I can explain anyhow.

What is an API, exactly? Basically, every time you want to access different sets of data from different big name tech companies, and have it all in one fancy execution, super easy and super seamless, you are using an API, and you should be thankful they exist!
